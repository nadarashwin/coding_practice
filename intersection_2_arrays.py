# Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection.
# Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and
#  you may return the result in any order.


# Example 1:

# Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
# Output: [2,2]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
# Output: [4,9]
# Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
